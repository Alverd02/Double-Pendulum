I will asume that you already have python, fortran and gnuplot(optional) properly installed.

-How this programs work

I use fortran to compute the numerical solutions for each system and then using python(pygame) I make the simulation.

-How to use it

In each fortran file you can change the initial conditions to make your own numerical solutions, nothing more has to be changed, then run the python code and magic will be done :)

-More

There is a little gnuplot script to see the x,y graph. You can also change it to make your own plots or just run it.

Also, I did a script wit the angles and its velocity with time
